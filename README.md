# RekaAIO
Small AIO for https://reka.ai allowing for free image classification and text generation

# What Is This?
This is a program I made in my spare time

It can mass create accounts on reka and use them for chatting autonomously

Simply input your prompt into the text box along with an img link [ if you have one ]

After this wait for the response to be recieved

I will add a GUI at 10 stars ðŸ˜­
